        * README.RST: Rename from AAAREADME.1ST so GitHub will
        recognize it.   Update with more details about the versions of
        XLISP and SCM used, and list the projects I used it for.

        * SSTG.LSP, SSTG_TO_C.LSP: Update comments slightly in preparation
        for uploading to GitHub.

        * SSTG_TO_C.SCM: Finished porting SSTG_TO_C.LSP to Scheme,
        including adding command line argument processing, so it can be
        run non-interactively.

        * SSTG.SCM: Add command line argument processing, so it can be run
        non-interactively. 

        * SSTG_SETUP.COM: add a command procedure to define DCL
        symbols for foreign commands using SCM to run SSTG.SCM and
        SSTG_TO_C.SCM.
